# Fruit-quality-prediction-using-Deeplearning

1)	Our first step is to make a working dataset from folders.
2)	Then converting to Gray scale and resize them to specific shape.
3)	Then we made a training and test data set for training of the  model
4)	After making training and test data set we trained a classic SGD linear classifier to get a base accuracy.
5)	After tweaking some parameters and more classical ML models we made a decision to move to the deep learning approach .
6)	In deep learning approach we used only sequential api models with some tweaks.
7)	Some pre-processing is done to get better results.
